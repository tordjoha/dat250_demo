# Experiment 4: JPA

## Technical problems during installation and use of JPA and how I resolved it
- Had to change imports to own package name
- I had added an UUID when creating a new user, but with the database being the one to assign one, I removed it
- Some methods were missing when importing the PollsTest.java, so I had to update the classes somewhat to incorporate these new methods
- Implemented some missing methods which I felt were needed for the workings for the rest of the application like getting all users and creating mappings for these.
